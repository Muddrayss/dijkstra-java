## Overview

The main classes include:
- `Node`: Represents individual nodes or vertices in the graph. Contains attributes like `name`, `distance`, `shortestPath`, and `adjacentNodes`.
- `GraphEnnio`: Represents the entire graph. Contains methods to calculate the shortest path and display the nodes in a stylized format.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**
   
   Create nodes and add them to the graph.
   ```java
   Node nodeA = new Node("A");
   GraphEnnio graph = new GraphEnnio();
   graph.addNode(nodeA);
   ```

2. **Add Destinations**

   Define connections and their weights between nodes.
   ```java
   Node nodeB = new Node("B");
   nodeA.addDestination(nodeB, 10);
   ```

3. **Calculate Shortest Path**

   Calculate the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.
   ```java
   graph.calculateShortestPath(nodeA);
   ```

4. **Display Nodes**

   Print the nodes in a stylized ASCII format.
   ```java
   graph.printFoundNodes();
   ```

## Abstracted Rules

The underlying logic for the shortest path algorithm is based on the following rules:

1. Every time we set out to visit a new node, we choose the node with the smallest known distance/cost to visit first.
2. Once weâ€™ve moved to the node weâ€™re going to visit, we check each of its neighboring nodes.
3. For each neighboring node, we calculate the distance/cost for the neighboring nodes by summing the cost of the edges that lead to the node weâ€™re checking from the starting vertex.
4. If the distance/cost to a node is less than a known distance, we update the shortest distance on file for that vertex.

## Features

- Efficient representation of a graph using a set of nodes.
- Dijkstra-inspired algorithm to determine the shortest path.
- Stylized console output for better visualization of nodes.
